# Clothing FaQTory

---

ClothingFaQTory is a management software designed for a company that produces
clothing items and accessories. The core functionalities it provides are
managing an inventory of the different types of products and calculating their
production cost. Its aim is to help managers and business analysts to establish
the final selling price of the aforementioned items.

The calculation is based on the cost of the prime materials per unit (such as
the price of denim per meter) which is then multiplied by the approximate
surface of the final product, in order to estimate the quantity of material
needed.

The price is not stored with all the other information: the cost of the
materials is rather dynamic over time, being influenced by economy and other
factors. Therefore, the software allows to easily change the cost of the prime
materials and obtain an immediate recalculation of the product prices, without
having to update all the records in the database. In a real world scenario,
with possibly thousands of products, this operation would be really onerous.
